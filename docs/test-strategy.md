## Key Areas of Focus
1. Search relevance and filters
2. Schedule creation and availability logic
3. Authentication (login/logout/session)
4. Role-based access (mentee vs mentor)
5. Booking conflicts and double booking
6. Session confirmation/cancellation flows
7. Data validation and error handling

## Assumptions
1. Login is required for scheduling.
2. Time slots are managed per mentor.
3. Session conflicts and duplicate bookings must be prevented.
4. APIs exist for booking, user info, mentor data, etc.
